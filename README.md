# parselmouth_specanalysis_demo
A demonstration of using the `parselmouth` library to obtain certain spectral information from audio files.  Provides an incidental demonstration of methods for integrating `audiolabel` with `pandas`.

This notebook originally written to assist [Ernesto Gutiérrez (UC Berkeley)](http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/people/gutierrez-ernesto/) in processing of audio data collected for a research project.  *Sample audio and annotated TextGrids included with explicit permission from Gutiérrez and relevant participants.*
